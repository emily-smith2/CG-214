            <p>Many of the Chrome Experiments are enjoyable to look at, this visualization is out of this world educational! By simply zooming in or out with a mouse, users may begin with the sun and learn about over 100,000 nearby stars. </p>
            
            <p>A few elements that I appreciate:</p>
            <p>
            <ul>
                    <li>Interactive tour</li>
                    <li>Ability to change perspectives</li>
                    <li>Scientifically based</li>
                    <li>Educational, seamlessly connected to Wikipedia</li>
                    
                </ul>
            <p>These are the stars closest in our solar system.  It would take 18 years for a jet airplane to fly to the sun. <p>The furthest man made object, Voyager 1 is now almost 17 light hours away. The length of one light year is the distance light can travel in a year.  </p>

<!--I was confident I knew how to do this but then ran into trouble with the organization of the files. When I tried to upload and send it to you earlier today the web page kept appearing how it did on my desktop. It appeared as a root folder and sub folders, not as a web page. Everything else was simple and I'm looking forward to css. I am slightly familiar with it as I have used it with my blogs. See you tomorrow-->
