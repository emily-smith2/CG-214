            <p>Many of the Chrome Experiments are enjoyable to look at, this visualization is out of this world educational! By simply zooming in or out with a mouse, users may begin with the sun and learn about over 100,000 nearby stars. </p>
            
            <p>A few elements that I appreciate:</p>
            <p>
            <ul>
                    <li>Interactive tour</li>
                    <li>Ability to change perspectives</li>
                    <li>Scientifically based</li>
                    <li>Educational, seamlessly connected to Wikipedia</li>
                    
                </ul>
            <p>These are the stars closest in our solar system.  It would take 18 years for a jet airplane to fly to the sun. <p>The furthest man made object, Voyager 1 is now almost 17 light hours away. The length of one light year is the distance light can travel in a year.  </p>
